# MyFirstApp
This is my first Android App
I am actually learning how to use GitHub in working together and hence I am trying to understand the procedures that are required for uploading a directory as a git repository.
All suggestions will be welcomed.

Also it will be great help if someone can suggest me some sites to learn git.

Thank You.
